A Virtual Reality-based Hand Rehabilitation Device for Post-Stroke Therapy

Post-stroke hand rehabilitation is critical for restoring fine motor skills and functional independence, but traditional therapies often lack patient engagement. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising solution, offering an interactive and engaging platform to support motor recovery. Gamified rehabilitation exercises are particularly effective in improving adherence and outcomes (Laver et al., 2017). This project focuses on a VR-enabled glove with flex sensors that tracks finger movements and provides real-time feedback through interactive exercises. By translating physical hand movements into virtual actions, the device helps patients perform necessary therapeutic exercises with increased motivation. Key benefits include:

1 . Enhanced engagement through gamified tasks. 
2 . Adaptability for individual patient mobility. 
3 . Potential integration into remote physiotherapy programs.
